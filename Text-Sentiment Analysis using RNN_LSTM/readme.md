## Text-Sentiment Analysis using RNN/LSTM 
### 📖 Description: 
Built a Recurrent-Neural Network(RNN) with LSTM layers to predict sentiment
(Positive/Negative/Neutral) from text data such as movie reviews and social media posts .
The model effectively captured long -term dependencies in text for improved sentiment classification.

### 🚀 Key Features
*  **Text Preprocessing**: Pre-processed textual dataset with tokenization,padding and embedding
*  **Feature Extraction**:Used word embeddings-Embedding Layer to represent words in dense vector space
*  **Model**:Designed an LSTM-based deep-learning model capable of handling sequential dependencies  in text
*  **Model Improvement**:Implemented dropout layers to prevent overfitting and improve generalisation
*  **Optimizer**:Trained model with Adam Optimizer and binary/multiclass-cross entropy loss
